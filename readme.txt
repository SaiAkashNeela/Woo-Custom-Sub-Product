== Frequently Asked Questions ==

*   **Does this work with all themes?**
    *   This plugin is designed to be as theme-compatible as possible, primarily using WooCommerce hooks and standard WordPress UI elements. However, conflicts with heavily customized themes are possible. We recommend testing thoroughly.

*   **Can I customize the appearance of the modal?**
    *   The plugin will use its own stylesheet for the modal. You can override these styles with your own custom CSS.
